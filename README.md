**Setting up**

Before using the speech to text capabilities you need to download the deepspeech models by using the following commands:

```
curl -LO https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/v0.9.3/deepspeech-0.9.3-models.pbmm
curl -LO https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/v0.9.3/deepspeech-0.9.3-models.scorer
```
Then move the two files into the 'deepspeech' folder.

Finally you need to get an API key from google, get a discord token and the IDs of your discord channels. These should be put in 'credentials.py'.

**Using the bot**

for speech to text run **main.py**

for Q&A run **QandA.py**
